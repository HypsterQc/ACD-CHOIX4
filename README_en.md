# INF4150 // Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

In the INF4150 course, I learn how to design human-computer interfaces using proven design methods. The syllabus covers cognitive models, user typologies, interface classifications, and dialogue styles between users and machines. I also explore creating contextual help and user guides. Practical assignments involve designing and prototyping interfaces using Figma, giving me hands-on experience in creating functional and user-friendly interfaces.
